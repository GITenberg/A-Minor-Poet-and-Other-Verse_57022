<span class="ig"><span class="letra">H</span>ERE is the phial; here I turn the key<br /></span>
<span class="ih">Sharp in the lock. Click!&mdash;there’s no doubt it turned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the third time; there is luck in threes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Queen Luck, that rules the world, befriend me now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And freely I’ll forgive you many wrongs!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as the draught began to work, first time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tom Leigh, my friend (as friends go in the world),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst in, and drew the phial from my hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Ah, Tom! ah, Tom! that was a sorry turn!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lectured me a lecture, all compact<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of neatest, newest phrases, freshly culled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From works of newest culture: “common good;”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The world’s great harmonies;” “must be content<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With knowing God works all things for the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nature never stumbles.” Then again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The common good,” and still, “the common, good;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what a small thing was our joy or grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When weigh’d with that of thousands. Gentle Tom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you might wag your philosophic tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From morn till eve, and still the thing’s the same:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am myself, as each man is himself&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feels his own pain, joys his own joy, and loves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his own love, no other’s. Friend, the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is but one man; one man is but the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am I, and you are Tom, that bleeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When needles prick your flesh (mark, yours, not mine).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must confess it; I can feel the pulse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-beating at my heart, yet never knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The throb of cosmic pulses. I lament<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The death of youth’s ideal in my heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, to be honest, never yet rejoiced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the world’s progress&mdash;scarce, indeed, discerned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For still it seems that God’s a Sisyphus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the world for stone).<br /></span>
<span class="i8">You shake your head. I’m base,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ignoble? Who is noble&mdash;you or I?<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I was not once thus?</i> Ah, my friend, we are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Fates make us.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">This time is the third;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The second time the flask fell from my hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its drowsy juices spilt upon the board;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there my face fell flat, and all the life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crept from my limbs, and hand and foot were bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mighty chains, subtle, intangible;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While still the mind held to its wonted use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or rather grew intense and keen with dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An awful dread&mdash;I thought I was in Hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Hell, in Hell! Was ever Hell conceived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By mortal brain, by brain Divine devised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darker, more fraught with torment, than the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such as I? A creature maimed and marr’d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From very birth. A blot, a blur, a note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All out of tune in this world’s instrument.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A base thing, yet not knowing to fulfil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Base functions. A high thing, yet all unmeet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For work that’s high. A dweller on the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not content to dig with other men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because of certain sudden sights and sounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Bars of broke music; furtive, fleeting glimpse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of angel faces ’thwart the grating seen)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perceived in Heaven. Yet when I approach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch the sound’s completeness, to absorb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The faces’ full perfection, Heaven’s gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which then had stood ajar, sudden falls to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, a-shiver in the dark and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce hear afar the mocking tones of men:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“He would not dig, forsooth; but he must strive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For higher fruits than what our tillage yields;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold what comes, my brothers, of vain pride!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why play with figures? trifle prettily<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this my grief which very simply ’s said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“There is no place for me in all the world”?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world’s a rock, and I will beat no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A breast of flesh and blood against a rock....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stride across the planks for old time’s sake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, bare, small room that I have sorrowed in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay, and on sunny days, haply, rejoiced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know some things together, you and I!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold there, you rangèd row of books! In vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You beckon from your shelf. You’ve stood my friends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all things else were foes; yet now I’ll turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My back upon you, even as the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns it on me. And yet&mdash;farewell, farewell!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You, lofty Shakespere, with the tattered leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fathomless great heart, your binding’s bruised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet did I love you less? Goethe, farewell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell, triumphant smile and tragic eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pitiless world-wisdom!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i10">For all men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These two. And ’tis farewell with you, my friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More dear because more near: Theokritus;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heine that stings and smiles; Prometheus’ bard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I’ve grown too coarse for Shelley latterly:)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one wild singer of to-day, whose song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is all aflame with passionate bard’s blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lash’d into foam by pain and the world’s wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least, he has a voice to cry his pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For him, no silent writhing in the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No muttering of mute lips, no straining out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a weak throat a-choke with pent-up sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-throb with pent-up passion....<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Ah, my sun!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That’s you, then, at the window, looking in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To beam farewell on one who’s loved you long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And very truly. Up, you creaking thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You squinting, cobwebbed casement!<br /></span>
<span class="i15">So, at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can drink in the sunlight. How it falls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across that endless sea of London roofs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weaving such golden wonders on the grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That almost, for the moment, we forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world of woe beneath them.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Underneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the sunset glory, Pain is king.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, the sun’s there, and very sweet withal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I’ll not grumble that it’s only sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But open wide my lips&mdash;thus&mdash;drink it in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn up my face to the sweet evening sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(What royal wealth of scarlet on the blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So tender toned, you’d almost think it green)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stretch my hands out&mdash;so&mdash;to grasp it tight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ha, ha! ’tis sweet awhile to cheat the Fates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be as happy as another man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun works in my veins like wine, like wine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis a fair world: if dark, indeed, with woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet having hope and hint of such a joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a man, winning, well might turn aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careless of Heaven....<br /></span>
<span class="i10">O enough; I turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the sun’s light, or haply I shall hope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have hoped enough; I would not hope again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis hope that is most cruel.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Tom, my friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You very sorry philosophic fool;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis you, I think, that bid me be resign’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trust, and be thankful.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Out on you! Resign’d?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m not resign’d, not patient, not school’d in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take my starveling’s portion and pretend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m grateful for it. I want all, all, all;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ve appetite for all. I want the best:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love, beauty, sunlight, nameless joy of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s too much patience in the world, I think.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have grown base with crooking of the knee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mankind&mdash;say&mdash;God has bidden to a feast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The board is spread, and groans with cates and drinks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In troop the guests; each man with appetite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keen-whetted with expectance.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">In they troop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struggle for seats, jostle and push and seize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What’s this? what’s this? There are not seats for all!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some men must stand without the gates; and some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must linger by the table, ill-supplied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With broken meats. One man gets meat for two,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The while another hungers. If I stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without the portals, seeing others eat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I had thought to satiate the pangs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mine own hunger; shall I then come forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all is done, and drink my Lord’s good health<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In my Lord’s water? Shall I not rather turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curse him, curse him for a niggard host?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, I have hungered, hungered, through the years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till appetite grows craving, then disease;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am starved, wither’d, shrivelled.<br /></span>
<span class="i15">Peace, O peace!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This rage is idle; what avails to curse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nameless forces, the vast silences<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That work in all things.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">This time is the third,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wrought before in heat, stung mad with pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blind, scarcely understanding; now I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What thing I do.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">There was a woman once;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep eyes she had, white hands, a subtle smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft speaking tones: she did not break my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet haply had her heart been otherwise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine had not now been broken. Yet, who knows?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My life was jarring discord from the first:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ here and there brief hints of melody,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of melody unutterable, clove the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From this bleak world, into the heart of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dim, deep bosom of the universe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cast myself. I only crave for rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too heavy is the load. I fling it down.<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We knocked and knocked; at last, burst in the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found him as you know&mdash;the outstretched arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Propping the hidden face. The sun had set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the place was dim with lurking shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no written word to say farewell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or make more clear the deed.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">I search’d and search’d;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The room held little: just a row of books<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much scrawl’d and noted; sketches on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Done rough in charcoal; the old instrument<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(A violin, no Stradivarius)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He played so ill on; in the table drawer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Large schemes of undone work. Poems half-writ;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild drafts of symphonies; big plans of fugues;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some scraps of writing in a woman’s hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more&mdash;the scattered pages of a tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sorry tale that no man cared to read.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, my friend, I lov’d him well, tho’ he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held me a cold and stagnant-blooded fool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I am content to watch, and wait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a calm mind the issue of all things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Certain it is my blood’s no turbid stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, for all that, haply I understood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than he ever deem’d; nor held so light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poet in him. Nay, I sometimes doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they have not, indeed, the better part&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These poets, who get drunk with sun, and weep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the night or a woman’s face is fair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime there is much talk about my friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The women say, of course, he died for love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men, for lack of gold, or cavilling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of carping critics. I, Tom Leigh, his friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have no word at all to say of this.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, I had deem’d him more philosopher;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For did he think by this one paltry deed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cut the knot of circumstance, and snap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chain which binds all being?<br /></span>

<span class="ig"><span class="letra">W</span>HAT, have I waked again? I never thought<br /></span>
<span class="ih">To see the rosy dawn, or ev’n this grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dull, solemn stillness, ere the dawn has come.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lamp burns low; low burns the lamp of life:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The still morn stays expectant, and my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All weighted with a passive wonderment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiteth and watcheth, waiteth for the dawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come hither, maids; too soundly have ye slept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That should have watched me; nay, I would not chide&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft have I chidden, yet I would not chide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this last hour;&mdash;now all should be at peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have been dreaming in a troubled sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of weary days I thought not to recall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of stormy days, whose storms are hushed long since;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gladsome days, of sunny days; alas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dreaming, all their sunshine seem’d so sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though the current of the dark To-Be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had flow’d, prophetic, through the happy hours.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet, full well, I know it was not thus;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mind me sweetly of the summer days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, leaning from the lattice, I have caught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair, far glimpses of a shining sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, nearer, of tall ships which thronged the bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood out blackly from a tender sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All flecked with sulphur, azure, and bright gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the still, clear air have heard the hum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of distant voices; and methinks there rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No darker fount to mar or stain the joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which sprang ecstatic in my maiden breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than just those vague desires, those hopes and fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those eager longings, strong, though undefined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose very sadness makes them seem so sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What cared I for the merry mockeries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of other maidens sitting at the loom?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or for sharp voices, bidding me return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To maiden labour? Were we not apart&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I and my high thoughts, and my golden dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul which yearned for knowledge, for a tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That should proclaim the stately mysteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this fair world, and of the holy gods?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then followed days of sadness, as I grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To learn my woman-mind had gone astray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I was sinning in those very thoughts&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For maidens, mark, such are not woman’s thoughts&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And yet, ’tis strange, the gods who fashion us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have given us such promptings)....<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Fled the years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till seventeen had found me tall and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fairer, runs it, than Athenian maids<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are wont to seem; I had not learnt it well&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lesson of dumb patience&mdash;and I stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Life’s great threshold with a beating heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soul resolved to conquer and attain....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once, walking ’thwart the crowded market-place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With other maidens, bearing in the twigs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White doves for Aphrodite’s sacrifice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw him, all ungainly and uncouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet many gathered round to hear his words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tall youths and stranger-maidens&mdash;Sokrates&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw his face and marked it, half with awe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half with a quick repulsion at the shape....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The richest gem lies hidden furthest down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is the dearer for the weary search;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We grasp the shining shells which strew the shore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet swift we fling them from us; but the gem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We keep for aye and cherish. So a soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found after weary searching in the flesh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which half repelled our senses, is more dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that same seeking, than the sunny mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which lavish Nature marks with thousand hints<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a brow of beauty. We are prone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To overweigh such subtle hints, then deem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In after disappointment, we are fooled....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when, at length, my father told me all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I should wed me with great Sokrates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, foolish, wept to see at once cast down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maiden image of a future love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where perfect body matched the perfect soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But slowly, softly did I cease to weep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly I ’gan to mark the magic flash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leap to the eyes, to watch the sudden smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Break round the mouth, and linger in the eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To listen for the voice’s lightest tone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great voice, whose cunning modulations seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to the notes of some sweet instrument.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So did I reach and strain, until at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I caught the soul athwart the grosser flesh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again of thee, sweet Hope, my spirit dreamed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, guided by his wisdom and his love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led by his words, and counselled by his care,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should lift the shrouding veil from things which be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the flowing fountain of his soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refresh my thirsting spirit....<br /></span>
<span class="i15">And indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In those long days which followed that strange day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When rites and song, and sacrifice and flow’rs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaimed that we were wedded, did I learn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sooth, a-many lessons; bitter ones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which sorrow taught me, and not love inspired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which deeper knowledge of my kind impressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dark insistence on reluctant brain;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that great wisdom, deeper, which dispels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Narrowed conclusions of a half-grown mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sees athwart the littleness of life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature’s divineness and her harmony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was never poor Xantippe’s....<br /></span>
<span class="i15">I would pause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would recall no more, no more of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than just the incomplete, imperfect dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of early summers, with their light and shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their blossom-hopes, whose fruit was never ripe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But something strong within me, some sad chord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which loudly echoes to the later life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me to unfold the after-misery<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urges, with plaintive wailing in my heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, maidens, mark; I would not that ye thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I blame my lord departed, for he meant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No evil, so I take it, to his wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas only that the high philosopher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pregnant with noble theories and great thoughts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deigned not to stoop to touch so slight a thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the fine fabric of a woman’s brain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So subtle as a passionate woman’s soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think, if he had stooped a little, and cared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I might have risen nearer to his height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not lain shattered, neither fit for use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As goodly household vessel, nor for that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far finer thing which I had hoped to be....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death, holding high his retrospective lamp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shows me those first, far years of wedded life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere I had learnt to grasp the barren shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of what the Fates had destined for my life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as all youthful spirits are, was I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wholly incredulous that Nature meant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So little, who had promised me so much.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first I fought my fate with gentle words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With high endeavours after greater things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striving to win the soul of Sokrates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some slight bird, who sings her burning love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To human master, till at length she finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her tender language wholly misconceived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that same hand whose kind caress she sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fingers flippant flings the careless corn....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do remember how, one summer’s eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, seated in an arbour’s leafy shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had bade me bring fresh wine-skins....<br /></span>
<span class="i15">As I stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ling’ring upon the threshold, half concealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By tender foliage, and my spirit light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With draughts of sunny weather, did I mark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An instant the gay group before mine eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deepest in shade, and facing where I stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat Plato, with his calm face and low brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which met above the narrow Grecian eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pale, thin lips just parted to the smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which dimpled that smooth olive of his cheek.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head a little bent, sat Sokrates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one swart finger raised admonishing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the air were borne his changing tones.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low lounging at his feet, one fair arm thrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around his knee (the other, high in air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brandish’d a brazen amphor, which yet rained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright drops of ruby on the golden locks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And temples with their fillets of the vine),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay Alkibiades the beautiful.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus, with solemn tone, spake Sokrates:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“This fair Aspasia, which our Perikles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath brought from realms afar, and set on high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In our Athenian city, hath a mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I doubt not, of a strength beyond her race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And makes employ of it, beyond the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of women nobly gifted: woman’s frail&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her body rarely stands the test of soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She grows intoxicate with knowledge; throws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laws of custom, order,’neath her feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feasting at life’s great banquet with wide throat.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sudden, stepping from my leafy screen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding the swelling wine-skin o’er my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With breast that heaved, and eyes and cheeks aflame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lit by a fury and a thought, I spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“By all great powers around us! can it be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we poor women are empirical?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gods who fashioned us did strive to make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beings too fine, too subtly delicate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sense that thrilled response to ev’ry touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nature’s, and their task is not complete?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they have sent their half-completed work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bleed and quiver here upon the earth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bleed and quiver, and to weep and weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To beat its soul against the marble walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of men’s cold hearts, and then at last to sin!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ceased, the first hot passion stayed and stemmed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frighted by the silence: I could see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Framed by the arbour foliage, which the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In setting softly gilded with rich gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those upturned faces, and those placid limbs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw Plato’s narrow eyes and niggard mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which half did smile and half did criticise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One hand held up, the shapely fingers framed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gesture of entreaty&mdash;“Hush, I pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not disturb her; let us hear the rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follow her mood, for here’s another phase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your black-browed Xantippe....”<br /></span>
<span class="i15">Then I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Alkibiades, with laughing lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half-shut eyes, contemptuous shrugging up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft, snowy shoulders, till he brought the gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of flowing ringlets round about his breasts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sokrates, all slow and solemnly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raised, calm, his face to mine, and sudden spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I thank thee for the wisdom which thy lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have thus let fall among us: prythee tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From what high source, from what philosophies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Didst cull the sapient notion of thy words?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stood I straight and silent for a breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dumb, crushed with all that weight of cold contempt;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But swiftly in my bosom there uprose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sudden flame, a merciful fury sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save me; with both angry hands I flung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The skin upon the marble, where it lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spouting red rills and fountains on the white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, all unheeding faces, voices, eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fled across the threshold, hair unbound&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White garment stained to redness&mdash;beating heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flooded with all the flowing tide of hopes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which once had gushed out golden, now sent back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift to their sources, never more to rise....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think I could have borne the weary life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The narrow life within the narrow walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he had loved me; but he kept his love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this Athenian city and her sons;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, haply, for some stranger-woman, bold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With freedom, thought, and glib philosophy....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah me! the long, long weeping through the nights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weary watching for the pale-eyed dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which only brought fresh grieving: then I grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fiercer, and cursed from out my inmost heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Fates which marked me an Athenian maid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then faded that vain fury; hope died out;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A huge despair was stealing on my soul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sort of fierce acceptance of my fate,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wished a household vessel&mdash;well ’twas good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he should have it! He should have no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yearning treasure of a woman’s love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But just the baser treasure which he sought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I called my maidens, ordered out the loom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spun unceasing from the morn till eve;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching all keenly over warp and woof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weighing the white wool with a jealous hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I spun until, methinks, I spun away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul from out my body, the high thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out my spirit; till at last I grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ye have known me,&mdash;eye exact to mark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The texture of the spinning; ear all keen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For aimless talking when the moon is up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ye should be a-sleeping; tongue to cut<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With quick incision, ’thwart the merry words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of idle maidens....<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Only yesterday<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My hands did cease from spinning; I have wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My dreary duties, patient till the last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods reward me! Nay, I will not tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The after years of sorrow; wretched strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With grimmest foes&mdash;sad Want and Poverty;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet the time of horror, when they bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My husband from the threshold; nay, nor when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The subtle weed had wrought its deadly work.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! alas! I was not there to soothe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last great moment; never any thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her that loved him&mdash;save at least the charge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All earthly, that her body should not starve....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You weep, you weep; I would not that ye wept;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such tears are idle; with the young, such grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon grows to gratulation, as, “her love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was withered by misfortune; mine shall grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All nurtured by the loving,” or, “her life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was wrecked and shattered&mdash;mine shall smoothly sail.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough, enough. In vain, in vain, in vain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods forgive me! Sorely have I sinned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all my life. A fairer fate befall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You all that stand there....<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Ha! the dawn has come;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see a rosy glimmer&mdash;nay! it grows dark;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why stand ye so in silence? throw it wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The casement, quick; why tarry?&mdash;give me air&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O fling it wide, I say, and give me light!<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
